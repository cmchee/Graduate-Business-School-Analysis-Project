Let's say you want to pursue a career in Business. One of the most common ways to further your business career is to obtain an Masters in Business Administration (MBA). You take all your required tests, write your personal statements, and get all your letters of recommendations. But which schools should you apply to? How do you know if the school you get into will land you a business job that pays well?

In this analysis, we will be looking at the top Business programs ranked by [U.S. News][https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/mba-rankings] and assessing which schools are ranked the best by salary, employment rate, tuition costs, and more. We will compare different ranked schools and determine if ranks really matter in the Business field. At the end of this analysis, you should have a better understanding of which schools are considered the "best" and have an easier time choosing which programs are the best for you.
